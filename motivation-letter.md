Dear Dr Mark van der Loo,
\bigskip

Please consider our article titled "Teaching Computers to See Patterns in Scatterplots with Scagnostics" for publication in the R Journal.

The manuscript introduces the new package called `cassowaryr` which provides a user-friendly method to apply scagnostics to data in R and examples on how one can use these scagnostics to explore data. Scagnostics are a metric used to describe the shapes in scatter plots, and can be a useful dimension reduction technique. This package calculates the scagnostics in R and without binning, which makes the package more accessible compared to existing scagnostics packages that are simply wrappers for C++ code.

We believe the readers of the R Journal will find this article helpful because scanogstics are commonly used in data analysis, and are required for other popular packages such as `tourr` and `ggobi`. This paper provides details on an actively maintained package and discusses potential pitfalls that may arrise in their use.
